# Welcome to the mean stack (own boilerplate app)

The mean stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for cloud native fullstack javascript applications.   
MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

- **M**ongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript

This includes requirements, installation & deploy.

### Pre-requisites
* git - [Installation guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) .  
* node.js - [Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) .  
* npm - comes with node or download yarn - [Download page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) .  
* mongodb - [Download page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) .  

### Installation 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rngShard/mean.git
cd mean
cp .env.example .env    # then adjust config params
npm install
```
For development, continue with
```bash
npm start
```
where as production requires
```bash
npm run-script build
node server/index.js
``` 

### Deployment
For linux-based systems, [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) can be nciely used to deploy & monitor node applications as services.
